# CrystallographyClassification

The contents of this repo require a private Julia module, `AtomicGraphNets.jl` to run. It may be made available conditionally in the future. Other dependencies include:

- `Flux.jl`
- `GeometricFlux.jl`
- `ChemistryFeaturization.jl`

`AtomicGraphNets.jl` and `ChemistryFeaturization.jl` are component packages of the ARPA-E project.

Please run the Julia files using their eponymous Slurm batch scripts, so as not to take up precious computing resources on your head node.
